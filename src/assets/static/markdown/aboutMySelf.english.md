# Hi!

## I'm a data scientist who loves mathematics.

## Professional in AI computer vision and data analysis.

I love studying the latest AI technology and applying it to reality, but I believe AI is just one of the ways to realize valuable things. There are many situations where I should understand and utilize better algorithms to develop all processes, so I study data structures and algorithms these days.
